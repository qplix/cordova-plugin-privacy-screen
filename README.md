# PrivacyBlurScreen (cordova-plugin-privacy-screen)

This plugin hides your app's actual content while it resides in the background (i.e. when previewed in task manager). PrivacyBlurScreen therefore blurs your app's content as soon as it is about to be moved to the background.

Please note, that this plugin currently only supports iOS. iOS versions without blur support won't blur at all. (TODO)

## Installation
* Add: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/qplix/cordova-plugin-privacy-screen.git`
* Remove: `cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-privacy-screen`

## OS support
This plugin currently supports iOS with blur support exclusively.
